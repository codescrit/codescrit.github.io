Let's say you want your users to upload a file to your web site. How would you do it. 

It sounds pretty easy, isn't it? However, I was out of web development for a while and found it a bit challenging.

It probably will have some code snippets like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
