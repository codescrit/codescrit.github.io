### What is the simplest, easiest and fastest way to create Static Web Site?

First I thought it could Word Press, but I found myself drowned in a see of pages to setup different parts of the site. I am not new to web development, but found it a bit overwhelming to navigate through bunch of property screens.

Frustrated, I jumped searched Google and of course there were plenty of aadvices from all over the world. Everybody have their favorite way of develping web sites. One thing cought my attention: quite a bit of people were talking about github pages. I decided to give it a try.



It probably will have some code snippets like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
