# codescrit.github.io
Sample web site for my org.

`gh-pages` branch is sampling `minima` theme and all the code is under `/docs` folder. Folders and files in the root are a placeholders and should be removed (shortly).

Site is configured to deploy from `gh-pages` branch and `/docs` folder.

To test the site locally run command below in the terminal from the `/docs` folder
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
Terminal will show the url site is available on, `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` and how to stop the server.

All the changes you do to files will be immediately avialbe in the browser. However, to see config changes you would need to restart the server.

`index.md` contains all the info for the `Home` page.

`about.md` - `About` page under `About` tab.

`contact.md` - `Contact Us` page under `Contact Us` tab.

Blogs should appear under the separate `Blogs` tab.
